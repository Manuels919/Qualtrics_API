# Qualtrics API Export

Working at Buffalo State University in the Intsitututional Effectiveness and Planning department, one of the main tools we used was Qualtrics. My boss created dozens of surveys using qualtrics that were utilized daily, unfortunately, every time we wanted to export the data we had to manually download each export from each survey. I created this script that utilizes the qualtrics API and allows us to get the export for each survey by simplying providing the survey ID and our API token.
